2. **Create a new file** with a descriptive name (e.g., `data_imputation.py`)

3. **Follow the standard format**:
   ```python
   """
   Topic: Problem Title
   Problem: Clear description of the problem
   """
   
   import necessary_libraries
   
   def create_sample_data():
       """Create sample dataset for demonstration"""
       pass
   
   def solve_problem():
       """Main solution implementation"""
       pass
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Example usage
       pass
   ```

4. **Include**:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Well-commented code
   - Sample data generation
   - Example output
   - Visualizations where appropriate
